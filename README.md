# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains code for the JHU Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Coure Project

CodeBook.md describes how to use the run_analysis script, what data goes into it and how it functions at each step.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to run the analysis required by the project.

The output of the run_analysis.R is the Final_Data_Table.txt file.

Here is the assignment:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
